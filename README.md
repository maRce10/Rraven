The `Rraven` package is designed to facilitate the exchange of data
between R and [Raven sound analysis
software](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/) ([Cornell Lab of
Ornithology](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/home)).
[Raven](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/) provides very powerful tools for
the analysis of (animal) sounds. R can simplify the automatization of
complex routines of analyses. Furthermore, R packages as
[warbleR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=warbleR),
[seewave](https://cran.r-project.org/package=seewave) and
[monitoR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=monitoR) (among others)
provide additional methods of analysis, working as a perfect complement
for those found in [Raven](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/). Hence,
bridging these applications can largely expand the bioacoustician’s
toolkit.

Currently, most analyses in [Raven](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/)
cannot be run in the background from a command terminal. Thus, most
`Rraven` functions are design to simplify the exchange of data between
the two programs.

Install/load the package from CRAN as follows:

``` r
# From CRAN 
install.packages("Rraven")

#load package
library(Rraven)
```

To install the latest developmental version from
[github](https://github.com/) you will need the R package
[remotes](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools):

``` r
# From github
remotes::install_github("maRce10/Rraven")

#load package
library(Rraven)
```

The package vignette provides detailed examples for each function in
`Rraven`, including both the R code as well as the additional steps in
[Raven](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/) required to fully accomplished
the analyses. You can pull it up as follows:

``` r
vignette("Rraven")
```

The animations explaining additional steps in
[Raven](https://www.ravensoundsoftware.com/) are shown in more detail on the
[github](https://github.com/maRce10/Rraven) version of this vignette,
which can be downloaded as follows (saves the file “Rraven.github.html”
in your current working directory):

``` r
download.file(url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maRce10/Rraven/master/gifs/Rraven.hitgub.html", 
destfile = "Rraven.hitgub.html")
```

The downloaded file can be opened by any internet browser.
