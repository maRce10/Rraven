\title{Modify sound file path in Raven's selection tables}
\usage{
fix_path(path = NULL, dest.path = NULL, recursive = FALSE, parallel = 1, pb = TRUE, 
new.begin.path, sound.file.col, files = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{A character string indicating the path of the directory in which to look for the 'Raven' selection (text) files. 
If not provided (default) the function searches into the current working directory.}

\item{dest.path}{A character string indicating the path of the directory in which
sound selection tables will be saved. If not supplied selection files will be overwritten with the new begin path.
If not provided (default) files will be save in the current directory.}

\item{recursive}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} the listing recurses into sub-directories.}

\item{parallel}{Numeric. Controls whether parallel computing is applied.
It specifies the number of cores to be used. Default is 1 (i.e. no parallel computing).}

\item{pb}{Logical argument to control progress bar. Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{new.begin.path}{A character string indicating the path of the directory where sound files 
would be located. This argument is required.}

\item{sound.file.col}{A character string with the name of the column containing the sound file names in 
the selection text files. Required.}

\item{files}{Character vector indicating the name of selection files (in .txt format) to be imported. Optional. Default is \code{NULL}.}
}
\value{
Selection table file(s) saved in 'dest.path' or in the working 
directory (by default, which overwrites existing files).
}
\description{
\code{fix_path} modifies the path column in selection tables and sound selection tables
}
\details{
The function modifies the path field in Raven's selection tables or 
sound selection tables. This is useful when sound files have been moved to a 
different location (or computer). Note that the ability to open selections and sound files
simultaneously works as long as the "begin.path" column is referring to the directory
containing the sound files.

\examples{
{
# load warbleR for sound file examples
library(NatureSounds)

#load data 
data(list = c("Phae.long1", "Phae.long2", "Phae.long3", "Phae.long4", "selection_files"))

# save sound files
tuneR::writeWave(Phae.long1, file.path(tempdir(), "Phae.long1.wav"), extensible = FALSE)
tuneR::writeWave(Phae.long2, file.path(tempdir(), "Phae.long2.wav"), extensible = FALSE)
tuneR::writeWave(Phae.long3, file.path(tempdir(), "Phae.long3.wav"), extensible = FALSE)
tuneR::writeWave(Phae.long4, file.path(tempdir(), "Phae.long4.wav"), extensible = FALSE)   
# save 'Raven' selection tables in the temporary directory
out <- lapply(1:2, function(x)
writeLines(selection_files[[x]], con = file.path(tempdir(), names(selection_files)[x])))

# try drag and drop selection files into Raven (shouldn't work)

# now fix files
fix_path(path = tempdir(), 
sound.file.col = "Begin File", new.begin.path = "YOUR NEW LOCATION HERE")

# try drag and drop into Raven again (should work now)
}
